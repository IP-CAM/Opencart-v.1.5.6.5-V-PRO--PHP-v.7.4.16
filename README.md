# PLEASE NOTE:
This Software is still in it's late Developer Stage, so, use it at your own Risk!
Just to have it mentioned, neither a Warranty exists, nor anything else, be aware of that!
To me, you're a DEV, if you wanna use it now, so, help me, to fix Misses, not the opposite!

# IMPORTANT THINGS TO CHANGE FIRST, before installing anything
1. RENAME the ROOT and ADMIN config-dist.php Files into config.php !

2. Check the Database for YOUR_SHOP_COM and YOUR_SHOP.COM Entries, and CHANGE them, 
to MATCH your Site PATHS and URL.

3. Also change the Admin admin@YOUR_SHOP.COM + User eMail beni@YOUR_SHOP.COM to match 
VALID Test Mail + User eMail Addresses.

4. Admin Demo Access Credentials: Admin / Password  ---  PRESENT Customer Access: beni@
(WHATEVER NEW SITENAME you added!) / beno

5. If you install the MyISAM default Database, ONLY index your DB by use of the TURBO.php 
File, you can later still SWITCH to INNO-DB in the ADMIN Section.

6. You might also select the INNODB coded Installation-Database, it's not tested, but it should 
also work.

7. You might have to re-install VqMod after a successful Installation, by clicking 
www.YOUR_SHOP.COM/vqmod/install/, to make VqMod work.

8. RENAME the .htaccess.txt File to .htaccess, to make it work as well.

9. Good Luck ! Don't forget, this is a DEVELOPER Version, with all the Consequences involved !
